// Otherwise, calculate delay, rev, delay, and return;
  short feed_delay = 145; // -8 Still works pretty well, perhaps a tiny bit more cold shots. // -16 same, cold shots like 1/5?
  // Could prob reduce at least -8 on storage voltage +, but to be on safe side, just go to 145.
  // However, when below (7.2V vs 7.4V), expect suboptimal operation unless feed delay is manually incremented!s
