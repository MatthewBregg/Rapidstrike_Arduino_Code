Rapidgator overall FPS readings with 43 blasterparts morpheus

- 117 with elite style
- ~100 with brick/waffle
- 109 with accufakes

Can increase crush one more notch to bring them more up, adding larger wheels would put me over with elite for sure, and be on the edge for some shots at uf, but for 130 end war would prob be fine.

As a good low velocity, sub 120 FPS blaster that leaves no questions, I'm fine with it for now, will make cage swappable though via bullets.
